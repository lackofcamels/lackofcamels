                            rock is formed when either of the other two are compressed under intense heat and pressure.

                        <h2>Mining tax</h2>
                        <p>The minig tax in Australia was a tax of 30% of the "superprofits" of non-renewable reasourses. It was supposed to raise $22.5 billion but it didn’t, only $2 billion dollars were actually raised in 2012. It only cost $60 million
                            dollars to run per year including advertising so it was profited more than 1.5 Billion dollars. When a liberal coalition was formed in 2013 the liberals took pity on these poor mining companies, who were barely paying the tax
                            anyway, and repealed this tax which as gave the Australian people $1.9 billion dollars.</p>
